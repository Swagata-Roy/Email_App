She had a presence about her that was magnetic.\n\nWe were seated alphabetically so we ended up next to each other. I was immediately drawn to her insightful comments and questions during the lecture. There was an undeniable chemistry between us.\n\nAfter class, I gathered the courage to ask if she wanted to grab coffee at the campus cafe. We ended up talking for hours about philosophy, art, music, poetry - everything under the sun. I was captivated by her free spirit and creative mind.\n\nMeeting Sarah opened up my world. She helped me see life through a poetic lens and nurtured my romantic side. I fell completely in love with her kind heart and beautiful mind.

As you know, I was an English major and my passions have always been language, art, and culture.\n\nI appreciate that programming languages have their own structure and poetry though. From what little I understand, OOP seems to be a way of organizing code into 'objects' that represent elements like characters in a story. The objects can interact and affect one another, right?\n\nIt's an interesting metaphor - life and relationships as a series of interacting objects. Very philosophical!

Robert was laser-focused on academia and getting his PhD, while I yearned to travel the world and have new adventures. He wanted to plant roots in one place, and I needed the freedom to go wherever my heart desired.\n\nAs painful as it was, I realized our paths were diverging in ways that would be very difficult to reconcile. I cared about him deeply, but I knew I needed to follow my own dreams, even if that meant letting him go.\n\nEnding our relationship was heartbreaking, because it felt like closing the door on a future we had imagined together. But I knew that holding on would only hurt us both in the long run. I had to be true to myself. I will always cherish the time we shared. Robert is an exceptional person.
